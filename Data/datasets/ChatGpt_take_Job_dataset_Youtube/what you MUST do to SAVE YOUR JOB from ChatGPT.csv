Its true that you will basically become an AI prompt for it to generate your code... but whereas before we had teams of 4-5 people - you now only need 1 person.

The number of jobs removed will far exceed the number of new opportunities created because lets face it - most engineering jobs are about the menial tasks and those engineers are now gone.  Thats great for a business' bottom line but where do you go next if you lost that job?  There's only trade jobs underneath and those are starting at basically poverty wages and one person that is in their middle age years is basically removed from their house and what not to go pursue a new poverty wage job just to have a job unless they happen to luck into one of these jobs that are created.

The whole point of AI and why they are pouring billions into it isn't to generate more jobs - its to make jobs more efficient and cost less to perform (removal of salaries).

1. Currently, systems like OpenAIs ChatGPT are running entirely off of open-source code, that is they're trained on publicly available code bases. It would thus take the active effort of retraining these models on proprietary code bases which may not even be possible yet due to restrictions placed on APIs provided by the respective companies. That would mean that a company may have to train its own models which requires a lot of things, but mainly money as that is attached to everything else like talent acquisition and data.
2. Networking speed: Seriously, how is this not talked about more? How often has anyone here experienced how numbingly slow these services sometimes are? Using networking tokens might remedy that for a small amount of users paying a premium on computational resources, but that will only tenfold once companies start actively using these services. We'd have to experiment with and create infrastructures that might need to support an exponential increase in computational resources to fulfill requests.

And besides, let's talk again when we actually don't have to do any more copy-and-pasting of chat output and have that system actively running in the OS with all required data feeds that somehow need to communicate with one another.","You make a couple of valid points, but you're also making the same unsubstantiated claims that I often see people who are not software engineers make.
