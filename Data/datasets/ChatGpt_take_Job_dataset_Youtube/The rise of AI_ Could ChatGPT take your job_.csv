His industry is moving towards having code done by A.I. That's a major part of the massive layoffs you've been seeing in the tech industry. 

A I. has already been writing news articles for many major online news sites (Buzzfeed for one). Software can now do a large part of my editorial work, and very soon will be able to do it all. 

It's ALREADY taking jobs. 

Within just a few years, writing is going to be only a hobby. Human authors (who need to pay bills) cannot compete against the cheap costs of A.I.-generated materials. As it is, most of the paying markets for short stories and articles have faded away with the loss of so many magazines. 

An author can spend weeks and months writing a book. Their editor will spend a couple of weeks editing it. All of these work hours need to be recompensed at a living wage, if it's not a hobby.

But A.I. will be able to do it all in mere moments. Have a story idea? Tell it to ChatGPT and have it write a bestselling book!

At this point, that's still not quite possible-- but it's damned close. The grammar and general story structure can be replicated by A.I. (usually far better than some of the authors I've edited). All it needs is a story and some tutoring on how to write a novel better than it's doing now. 

I came into publishing when newspaper layout was done with wax-backed paper columns, and custom typesetting machines used 8-inch floppy disks. I've seen a lot of changes in publishing, but nothing compared to this. 

This is far more than a calculator. It is a revolution in our society.","I am an editor and a writer. My husband works in I.T. We are both already seeing it take jobs NOW.
