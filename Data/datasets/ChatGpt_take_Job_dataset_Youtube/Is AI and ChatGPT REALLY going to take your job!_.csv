The answers given by chatGPT were full of STRONG mistakes. There were very good statements as for the usage of LaTeX in general, but not about specific things as Portuguese and Spanish hyphenation in order to guarantee the integrity of the book page. The chatGPT's answers were, most of them, very useful, but it was necessary a revision by myself.","Some days ago I asked chatGPT something as for a hard Latin language book publishing work.
