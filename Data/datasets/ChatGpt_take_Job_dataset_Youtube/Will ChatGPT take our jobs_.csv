1) The AI takes input and it got to be trained with mass of data. This input is based on OpenSource or OpenKnowledge ...and it takes this with no kind of credit or preserving copyrights or paying this source in some kind of way.
And then it turns this OpenSource/OpenKnowledge by processing and generation its output into some kind of proprietary, centralized, commercial product. ChatGPT doesn't tell you on which base and which references it used to give you the answer.
2) People who get used to ChatGPT may loose the grip to the ground on what they are doing. Maybe you will once not be able to judge, if the AI is wrong, but use it anyway, because it's too complex to understand in one lifetime.
