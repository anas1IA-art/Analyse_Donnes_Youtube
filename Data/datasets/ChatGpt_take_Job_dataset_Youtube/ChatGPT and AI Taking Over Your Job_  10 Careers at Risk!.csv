These companies want to outsource all their stuff to automation and artificial intelligence so they can mitigate as much as possible them having to pay in human labor for their products. But how will you keep the economy going if people don‚Äôt have money to buy these products these companies are making? This capitalistic system is like a snake eating its own tail. Not everyone is privileged enough or stable to just go back to school and get re-educated to learning a new skill. That just doesn‚Äôt seem like a pragmatic solution unless we are going to have it highly subsidized by the government, which I don‚Äôt see happening.","I don‚Äôt get it.
