Seek professional help: Consulting with a qualified mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist, can provide you with evidence-based treatments, such as therapy or medication, to effectively manage and overcome depression.

-Practice self-care: Taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional well-being is crucial. This includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle, engaging in regular exercise, getting enough sleep, and practicing relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing.

-Challenge negative thoughts: Identifying and challenging negative thoughts that contribute to depression can be helpful. Cognitive-behavioral techniques, such as reframing negative thoughts into more realistic and positive ones, can be practiced with the guidance of a therapist.

-Build a supportive network: Surrounding yourself with a supportive network of friends, family, or other individuals who understand and care about your well-being can provide emotional support and encouragement. Talking openly about your feelings and seeking support can help you feel less isolated.

-Engage in meaningful activities: Participating in activities that you enjoy and that promote your well-being, such as hobbies or volunteering, can help improve mood and overall well-being. Finding meaning and purpose in your daily life can contribute to a sense of fulfillment.

-Practice self-compassion: Be kind and compassionate towards yourself. Recognize that depression is not your fault and practice self-care and self-acceptance. Treat yourself with the same empathy and understanding that you would offer to a friend going through a difficult time.

-Follow a treatment plan: If you are receiving professional treatment for depression, it's important to follow your treatment plan as prescribed by your mental health professional. This may include attending therapy sessions, taking medication as prescribed, and following any other recommendations provided.

Please note that depression is a complex condition, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's essential to seek personalized professional help and create an individualized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.

It would thus take the active effort of retraining these models on proprietary code bases which may not even be possible yet due to restrictions placed on APIs provided by the respective companies.

Using networking tokens might remedy that for a small amount of users paying a premium on computational resources, but that will only tenfold once companies start actively using these services.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Jake who lived in a small town. One night, Jake had a nightmare that he was being chased by a monster. The monster was huge, with razor-sharp teeth and claws, and its eyes glowed a bright red. Jake ran as fast as he could, but the monster caught up with him and killed him in the most gruesome way imaginable.

Suddenly, Jake woke up, relieved that it had only been a bad dream. But as he looked around, he realized that he was in another dream. This time, he was in a dark forest, and he could hear the sound of something moving in the bushes. Suddenly, a second monster appeared. This one was even more terrifying than the first. It had a long, slimy body with multiple tentacles and glowing yellow eyes. Jake tried to run, but the monster grabbed him with its tentacles and devoured him whole.

Jake woke up again, sweating and shaking. He realized that he was stuck in a nightmare loop and was unable to wake up from his dreams. Each time he thought he was awake, he found himself in another dream, being chased by a different monster.

In the third dream, he was in a dark, abandoned house, and a third monster appeared. This one was a humanoid creature with long, sharp claws and a twisted, demonic face. It taunted Jake, telling him that he would never escape the nightmare.

In the fourth dream, he found himself in a maze, and a fourth monster appeared. This one was a giant spider with venomous fangs and glowing green eyes. It chased him through the maze, trapping him in its web and slowly devouring him.

In the fifth dream, he was in a graveyard, and a fifth monster appeared. This one was a ghostly apparition with a skeletal face and long, flowing robes. It chased him through the graveyard, moaning and wailing as it tried to catch him.

In the sixth dream, he was in a hospital, and a sixth monster appeared. This one was a mutant creature with multiple heads and tentacles, oozing with green slime. It chased him through the hospital, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.

In the seventh dream, he was in a dark, underground cave, and a seventh monster appeared. This one was a giant worm with razor-sharp teeth and glowing red eyes. It chased him through the cave, burrowing through the walls and floors to catch him.

In the eighth dream, he was in a haunted house, and an eighth monster appeared. This one was a demonic clown with razor-sharp teeth and a sinister grin. It chased him through the house, taunting him with its evil laughter.

In the ninth dream, Jake realized that he was only dreaming. He tried to take control of the dream and fight back against the monsters. But as he did so, a ninth monster appeared. This one was the most terrifying of them all. It was a dark, shadowy figure with glowing red eyes, and its mere presence filled Jake with dread. He tried to run, but the monster caught up with him and killed him with a single blow.

Jake woke up for real this time, gasping for air. He looked around his room, relieved to see that it was empty. But as he sat up, he realized that there was something in the corner of his room. It was the ninth monster, the same one that had killed him in his final dream. Its eyes glowed red as it advanced toward him, and Jake knew that he was going to die. The monster killed him with a single blow, and Jake's body was found the next morning, lifeless and cold.","Yeah, AI Will Definitely Replace Authors. Just Read This AI Generated Nightmare.

Will it replace copywriters/bloggers?
I think not because it is no different from one human being chosen over another.  If people like a particular blogger's or copywriter's style then they will follow that blogger or choose that copywriter regardless of whether they are human or not.  So if you like blogging or your a copywriter then keep doing it and use AI to help you deliver value faster but in your unique style.  Also, lets imagine most companies do use AI to produce their marketing material, pretty soon your going to see generic, non inspiring adverts and billboards popping up, just like big game studios keep to the tried and true while indie developers take risks and push boundaries.

Will it replace programmers?
Nope, I don't think so, even junior programmers.  I think this because writing code is not what brings value, programmers are always looking for ways to write less code, not more.  Sure, once in a galaxy far far away programmers were paid per lines of code but those days are long gone.  A programmer's value is in their ability to solve technical problems for the business in a timely, cost effective and scalable fashion. If an AI chatbot can help the programmer to do that by taking away the mundane tasks then all the better.  But hey, if you want to write the code yourself because you feel that you'll add more value that way (e.g. AI produced code wasn't optimized enough and that piece of code code had to be efficient, AI code was hard to read, it would be quicker for you to write the code than to explain to the AI what you want, etc), then write the code yourself, it's your choice.

Will it replace customer support staff?
 Again I don't think so.  It is one thing to tell send a customer a troubleshooting guide and quite another to connect with the customer on a level that an AI never could.  I can just imagine the PR fallout as a company goes into damage control because it's AI chatbot gave a customer the wrong advice and they ended up investing in the wrong product or taking out the wrong insurance policy.   Yes they will alleviate the more mundane aspect of CS in a similar way that an FAQ or a troubleshooting guide does but they will not replace people.

We have to keep in perspective that it is not technological advancements that replace jobs, it changes how we do jobs, yes, but it is people that make use of those advancements who overtake people who don't, simply because it allows them to deliver more value more often.  Whatever your job, understand your business, invest in yourself, and focus on delivering value while allowing AI to help keep your life interesting; no boring moments.","Interesting video.  I don't think chatGPT will be replacing any of the jobs described in this video. 
Will it replace copywriters/bloggers?
I think not because it is no different from one human being chosen over another.  If people like a particular blogger's or copywriter's style then they will follow that blogger or choose that copywriter regardless of whether they are human or not.  So if you like blogging or your a copywriter then keep doing it and use AI to help you deliver value faster but in your unique style.  Also, lets imagine most companies do use AI to produce their marketing material, pretty soon your going to see generic, non inspiring adverts and billboards popping up, just like big game studios keep to the tried and true while indie developers take risks and push boundaries.

Will it replace programmers?
Nope, I don't think so, even junior programmers.  I think this because writing code is not what brings value, programmers are always looking for ways to write less code, not more.  Sure, once in a galaxy far far away programmers were paid per lines of code but those days are long gone.  A programmer's value is in their ability to solve technical problems for the business in a timely, cost effective and scalable fashion. If an AI chatbot can help the programmer to do that by taking away the mundane tasks then all the better.  But hey, if you want to write the code yourself because you feel that you'll add more value that way (e.g. AI produced code wasn't optimized enough and that piece of code code had to be efficient, AI code was hard to read, it would be quicker for you to write the code than to explain to the AI what you want, etc), then write the code yourself, it's your choice.

Will it replace customer support staff?
 Again I don't think so.  It is one thing to tell send a customer a troubleshooting guide and quite another to connect with the customer on a level that an AI never could.  I can just imagine the PR fallout as a company goes into damage control because it's AI chatbot gave a customer the wrong advice and they ended up investing in the wrong product or taking out the wrong insurance policy.   Yes they will alleviate the more mundane aspect of CS in a similar way that an FAQ or a troubleshooting guide does but they will not replace people.

We have to keep in perspective that it is not technological advancements that replace jobs, it changes how we do jobs, yes, but it is people that make use of those advancements who overtake people who don't, simply because it allows them to deliver more value more often.

The game ""Virus X: The Virtual Apocalypse"" is a cooperative action-adventure game where players can choose to control one of the four heroes - Kratos, Master Chief, Doom Guy, and Steve - and team up to fight against the deadly virus known as Virus X.

The story begins with a group of scientists working on a virtual reality experiment, when suddenly Virus X breaks loose from their containment system and starts deleting every game in existence. The heroes must band together and stop Virus X before it destroys the virtual reality.

Each hero has their own unique abilities and weapons. Kratos is a skilled warrior armed with the Blades of Chaos, Master Chief is a supersoldier with the Mjolnir power armor, Doom Guy is a fearless space marine with the Super Shotgun, and Steve is a resourceful minecraft player with a diamond sword.

The game takes place in various virtual reality environments, such as ancient Greece, the outer space, a demonic hellscape, and a blocky Minecraft world. The players must navigate through these environments and fight against Virus X's minions, such as corrupted AI drones, demonic entities, and giant robots.

As the players progress through the game, they will encounter and fight against powerful bosses, such as the corrupted AI scientist who created Virus X, the demonic overlord that controls Virus X, and the final form of Virus X itself. These boss battles will require strategy and teamwork to overcome.

In addition to fighting against Virus X's minions, the players will also face challenges such as solving puzzles, completing objectives, and finding hidden items. These challenges will provide a break from the intense combat and add variety to the gameplay.

The game features a variety of weapons and upgrades that the players can find and unlock throughout the game. These weapons and upgrades can be used to improve the heroes' abilities and give them an edge against Virus X's minions.

The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can team up and play the game together. In multiplayer mode, players can choose to control different heroes and work together to defeat Virus X.

After defeating Virus X, the players will be hailed as heroes and the virtual reality will be saved from destruction. However, the game ends with a cliffhanger, where it is revealed that Virus X is not the only threat to the virtual reality, and the heroes must team up again to face even greater challenges in the future.

Overall, ""Virus X: The Virtual Apocalypse"" is an exciting and action-packed game that combines the elements of cooperative gameplay, challenging boss battles, and a compelling story. The game offers a unique experience for players who enjoy action-adventure games and the challenge of working together to overcome a deadly threat.","i put in the prompt ""write a game where a very dangerous virtual virus has broken loose and has started deleting every game in existence, but a group that consists of kratos from god of war, master chief from halo, doom guy from doom, and steve from minecraft.

His industry is moving towards having code done by A.I. That's a major part of the massive layoffs you've been seeing in the tech industry. 

A I. has already been writing news articles for many major online news sites (Buzzfeed for one). Software can now do a large part of my editorial work, and very soon will be able to do it all. 

It's ALREADY taking jobs. 

Within just a few years, writing is going to be only a hobby. Human authors (who need to pay bills) cannot compete against the cheap costs of A.I.-generated materials. As it is, most of the paying markets for short stories and articles have faded away with the loss of so many magazines. 

An author can spend weeks and months writing a book. Their editor will spend a couple of weeks editing it. All of these work hours need to be recompensed at a living wage, if it's not a hobby.

But A.I. will be able to do it all in mere moments. Have a story idea? Tell it to ChatGPT and have it write a bestselling book!

At this point, that's still not quite possible-- but it's damned close. The grammar and general story structure can be replicated by A.I. (usually far better than some of the authors I've edited). All it needs is a story and some tutoring on how to write a novel better than it's doing now. 

I came into publishing when newspaper layout was done with wax-backed paper columns, and custom typesetting machines used 8-inch floppy disks. I've seen a lot of changes in publishing, but nothing compared to this. 

This is far more than a calculator. It is a revolution in our society.","I am an editor and a writer. My husband works in I.T. We are both already seeing it take jobs NOW.

1. AI sucks at writing good code and it will never get better. There literally aren't enough lines of code to train a model substantially better than models are today. Maybe check back in 55 years.

2. AI doesn't understand security. This context is specifically human in its nature, an AI can no more implement strong security measures for regular updates than it can predict human behavior because the opponents of security are human. If an AI can tell you what you're thinking about doing in 10 minutes with only a general understanding of humans from some wikipedia articles, then you should start to worry about your job.

3. AI doesn't understand specialization. This context is also uniquely human. The requirements of your system likely hasn't been implemented in a way that makes sense for your organization before. If it had, you'd just use a package/library/framework/buy the company that made it/become their customer.

4. ChatGPT isn't doing anything new. Since GPT 2 released you have been able to use chat bots to write code. I have used GPT 2 to do so for hundreds of examples. The code is not any better or even any different today than it was then.

5. Copyright. AI uses copywritten code that belongs to another person or legal entity. The industry follows the Fortune 500, and the Fortune 500 suite of companies are not going to open themselves up to hundreds of trillions of dollars in liability because they don't want to pay several million for employees who have an ROI of unlimited:1

6. AI actually sucks are following directions. Go use an art AI to draw you some pictures and see if any of them are exactly what you imagined in your head to the last detail. To an AI, a picture and some code are no different, if it cannot get every single pixel of your imagined picture correct then it cannot get every bit of code correct.

7. AI sucks at planning. It cannot think about the 14,778 abstraction classes in your java project and feed you a billion lines of code that magically make an online bank and credit card company. There isn't enough RAM in the world, nor are there enough raw materials to produce enough RAM on Earth, to get an AI that can consider every single line of code in such a large project when it makes a new line.

8. Even if you could make an AI that uses context it is unaware of, AI will be very slow even though it appears to be faster than you because it is driven by the context it was modeled on. For any project beyond a single simple method from nothing, an AI cannot create working code using your specific implementations unless if it considers every other line of code. For a project that already exists, the ability to do this can be measured with the time complexity of O(n^X) where X is the number of lines of code you already have and n is the number of lines it must write. This is literally bruteforcing to make a few lines of code that wont produce an error when run in a project that already exists. For the record, if you have a large project that in total has 100 interactions that must be perfect... it would take the AI longer than the universe has left to guarantee a perfect result.

AI may one day make a useful general tool for programmers, but it can never replace the human mind. Context and intention are beyond the grasp of what we call AI today, which particularly lacks the ""I"" of AI. Truth be told, there is no true AI yet. Not even close, instead we have some ML systems that are trained to present specific patterns given a specific input, nothing more and nothing less. No different than running a command on Visual Studio to make a quickstart JS file.  You literally process over a petaFLOP of data to sneeze, there are no systems real or imagined that can match the one between your ears.","I think there are a large number of reasons the influencers are wrong again, making it 100% of the time still.

4. ChatGPT isn't doing anything new. Since GPT 2 released you have been able to use chat bots to write code. I have used GPT 2 to do so for hundreds of examples. The code is not any better or even any different today than it was then.

5. Copyright. AI uses copywritten code that belongs to another person or legal entity. The industry follows the Fortune 500, and the Fortune 500 suite of companies are not going to open themselves up to hundreds of trillions of dollars in liability because they don't want to pay several million for employees who have an ROI of unlimited:1

6. AI actually sucks are following directions. Go use an art AI to draw you some pictures and see if any of them are exactly what you imagined in your head to the last detail. To an AI, a picture and some code are no different, if it cannot get every single pixel of your imagined picture correct then it cannot get every bit of code correct.

7. AI sucks at planning. It cannot think about the 14,778 abstraction classes in your java project and feed you a billion lines of code that magically make an online bank and credit card company. There isn't enough RAM in the world, nor are there enough raw materials to produce enough RAM on Earth, to get an AI that can consider every single line of code in such a large project when it makes a new line.

8. Even if you could make an AI that uses context it is unaware of, AI will be very slow even though it appears to be faster than you because it is driven by the context it was modeled on. For any project beyond a single simple method from nothing, an AI cannot create working code using your specific implementations unless if it considers every other line of code. For a project that already exists, the ability to do this can be measured with the time complexity of O(n^X) where X is the number of lines of code you already have and n is the number of lines it must write. This is literally bruteforcing to make a few lines of code that wont produce an error when run in a project that already exists. For the record, if you have a large project that in total has 100 interactions that must be perfect... it would take the AI longer than the universe has left to guarantee a perfect result.

AI may one day make a useful general tool for programmers, but it can never replace the human mind. Context and intention are beyond the grasp of what we call AI today, which particularly lacks the ""I"" of AI. Truth be told, there is no true AI yet. Not even close, instead we have some ML systems that are trained to present specific patterns given a specific input, nothing more and nothing less. No different than running a command on Visual Studio to make a quickstart JS file.  You literally process over a petaFLOP of data to sneeze, there are no systems real or imagined that can match the one between your ears.",2022-12-12T05:27:27Z,2022-12-12T05:27:27Z,2,True,0

Shallow people thought the same about robots replacing manual workers.

As new innovation and technology become available  it changes how we acquire resources, like products and services. Automation and innovation is needed for us humans to be able to produce and have more things. Imagine building a house from scratch, literally no tools or materials. It would be extremely inefficient. This change and adaptation will always exist and will continue to because we humans create new things that create new things. The real question is how humans that are in control will act on these new changes. Businesses have choices. Firing or being more frugal are two of many choices. Humans must adapt to the new way of life such as every generation before have. The question is whether we do it sustainably with more of society included in the change equation.
