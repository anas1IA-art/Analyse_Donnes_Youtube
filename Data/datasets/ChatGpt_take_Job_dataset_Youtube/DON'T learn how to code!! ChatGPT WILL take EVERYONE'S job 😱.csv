1. AI sucks at writing good code and it will never get better. There literally aren't enough lines of code to train a model substantially better than models are today. Maybe check back in 55 years.

2. AI doesn't understand security. This context is specifically human in its nature, an AI can no more implement strong security measures for regular updates than it can predict human behavior because the opponents of security are human. If an AI can tell you what you're thinking about doing in 10 minutes with only a general understanding of humans from some wikipedia articles, then you should start to worry about your job.

3. AI doesn't understand specialization. This context is also uniquely human. The requirements of your system likely hasn't been implemented in a way that makes sense for your organization before. If it had, you'd just use a package/library/framework/buy the company that made it/become their customer.

4. ChatGPT isn't doing anything new. Since GPT 2 released you have been able to use chat bots to write code. I have used GPT 2 to do so for hundreds of examples. The code is not any better or even any different today than it was then.

5. Copyright. AI uses copywritten code that belongs to another person or legal entity. The industry follows the Fortune 500, and the Fortune 500 suite of companies are not going to open themselves up to hundreds of trillions of dollars in liability because they don't want to pay several million for employees who have an ROI of unlimited:1

6. AI actually sucks are following directions. Go use an art AI to draw you some pictures and see if any of them are exactly what you imagined in your head to the last detail. To an AI, a picture and some code are no different, if it cannot get every single pixel of your imagined picture correct then it cannot get every bit of code correct.

7. AI sucks at planning. It cannot think about the 14,778 abstraction classes in your java project and feed you a billion lines of code that magically make an online bank and credit card company. There isn't enough RAM in the world, nor are there enough raw materials to produce enough RAM on Earth, to get an AI that can consider every single line of code in such a large project when it makes a new line.

8. Even if you could make an AI that uses context it is unaware of, AI will be very slow even though it appears to be faster than you because it is driven by the context it was modeled on. For any project beyond a single simple method from nothing, an AI cannot create working code using your specific implementations unless if it considers every other line of code. For a project that already exists, the ability to do this can be measured with the time complexity of O(n^X) where X is the number of lines of code you already have and n is the number of lines it must write. This is literally bruteforcing to make a few lines of code that wont produce an error when run in a project that already exists. For the record, if you have a large project that in total has 100 interactions that must be perfect... it would take the AI longer than the universe has left to guarantee a perfect result.

AI may one day make a useful general tool for programmers, but it can never replace the human mind. Context and intention are beyond the grasp of what we call AI today, which particularly lacks the ""I"" of AI. Truth be told, there is no true AI yet. Not even close, instead we have some ML systems that are trained to present specific patterns given a specific input, nothing more and nothing less. No different than running a command on Visual Studio to make a quickstart JS file.  You literally process over a petaFLOP of data to sneeze, there are no systems real or imagined that can match the one between your ears.","I think there are a large number of reasons the influencers are wrong again, making it 100% of the time still.

I won't change my ways, I code for fun, I draw for fun, I create music and stories for fun. I don't care about this AI at all, and as I care about ethics, will most likely not use it even for fun, because I don't want to support it.

Thanks for making this video, coming from this prerspective.

I agree content creators are taking things out of proportion.

A.I's like these are still tools we gota learn to use to improve our productivity. 

Personally I've  used A.I's to generate images from text promts, and even if results are convincing, the images I've  gotten are far from perfect, with them being really hit or miss having to learn a lot on how such and such A.I. works just to get a decent image. To me it's more of a tool for graphics designers.

The things A.I. can do right now are impressive, but by themselves or used by someone that knows nothing or even basic level programming skills, A.I. will be pretty much useless.","Hi, dorian.
