As new innovation and technology become available  it changes how we acquire resources, like products and services.

It would be extremely inefficient. This change and adaptation will always exist and will continue to because we humans create new things that create new things. The real question is how humans that are in control will act on these new changes. Businesses have choices. Firing or being more frugal are two of many choices. Humans must adapt to the new way of life such as every generation before have. The question is whether we do it sustainably with more of society included in the change equation.
