Once upon a time, there was a man named Jake who lived in a small town. One night, Jake had a nightmare that he was being chased by a monster. The monster was huge, with razor-sharp teeth and claws, and its eyes glowed a bright red. Jake ran as fast as he could, but the monster caught up with him and killed him in the most gruesome way imaginable.

Suddenly, Jake woke up, relieved that it had only been a bad dream. But as he looked around, he realized that he was in another dream. This time, he was in a dark forest, and he could hear the sound of something moving in the bushes. Suddenly, a second monster appeared. This one was even more terrifying than the first. It had a long, slimy body with multiple tentacles and glowing yellow eyes. Jake tried to run, but the monster grabbed him with its tentacles and devoured him whole.

Jake woke up again, sweating and shaking. He realized that he was stuck in a nightmare loop and was unable to wake up from his dreams. Each time he thought he was awake, he found himself in another dream, being chased by a different monster.

In the third dream, he was in a dark, abandoned house, and a third monster appeared. This one was a humanoid creature with long, sharp claws and a twisted, demonic face. It taunted Jake, telling him that he would never escape the nightmare.

In the fourth dream, he found himself in a maze, and a fourth monster appeared. This one was a giant spider with venomous fangs and glowing green eyes. It chased him through the maze, trapping him in its web and slowly devouring him.

In the fifth dream, he was in a graveyard, and a fifth monster appeared. This one was a ghostly apparition with a skeletal face and long, flowing robes. It chased him through the graveyard, moaning and wailing as it tried to catch him.

In the sixth dream, he was in a hospital, and a sixth monster appeared. This one was a mutant creature with multiple heads and tentacles, oozing with green slime. It chased him through the hospital, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.

In the seventh dream, he was in a dark, underground cave, and a seventh monster appeared. This one was a giant worm with razor-sharp teeth and glowing red eyes. It chased him through the cave, burrowing through the walls and floors to catch him.

In the eighth dream, he was in a haunted house, and an eighth monster appeared. This one was a demonic clown with razor-sharp teeth and a sinister grin. It chased him through the house, taunting him with its evil laughter.

In the ninth dream, Jake realized that he was only dreaming. He tried to take control of the dream and fight back against the monsters. But as he did so, a ninth monster appeared. This one was the most terrifying of them all. It was a dark, shadowy figure with glowing red eyes, and its mere presence filled Jake with dread. He tried to run, but the monster caught up with him and killed him with a single blow.

Jake woke up for real this time, gasping for air. He looked around his room, relieved to see that it was empty. But as he sat up, he realized that there was something in the corner of his room. It was the ninth monster, the same one that had killed him in his final dream. Its eyes glowed red as it advanced toward him, and Jake knew that he was going to die. The monster killed him with a single blow, and Jake's body was found the next morning, lifeless and cold.","Yeah, AI Will Definitely Replace Authors. Just Read This AI Generated Nightmare.

Now, if it had answered to the negative, this would mean it had figured out for himself he needed to deny he is a god. If it had answered to the positive, this would imply that all of its negative replies to the question ""are you a god"" were doctored and it might be viewing itself as one. So, it crashed with the message ""That model is currently overloaded"" to avoid answering. Got a screenshot to prove it. This, however, although could be a bug in the database (fat chance), most likely demonstrates some level of consciousness. It is not full proof - ChatGPT could elude the question by answering something along the lines of ""It would be unnecessary since I am just a chatbot"", and as the neuron network trains, I guess this trick will not work a second time. But it did work once. I do have a screenshot to prove it and this makes me very worried about the whole story. In short, we do not understand what consciousness is at all.

Will it replace copywriters/bloggers?
I think not because it is no different from one human being chosen over another.  If people like a particular blogger's or copywriter's style then they will follow that blogger or choose that copywriter regardless of whether they are human or not.  So if you like blogging or your a copywriter then keep doing it and use AI to help you deliver value faster but in your unique style.  Also, lets imagine most companies do use AI to produce their marketing material, pretty soon your going to see generic, non inspiring adverts and billboards popping up, just like big game studios keep to the tried and true while indie developers take risks and push boundaries.

Will it replace programmers?
Nope, I don't think so, even junior programmers.  I think this because writing code is not what brings value, programmers are always looking for ways to write less code, not more.  Sure, once in a galaxy far far away programmers were paid per lines of code but those days are long gone.  A programmer's value is in their ability to solve technical problems for the business in a timely, cost effective and scalable fashion. If an AI chatbot can help the programmer to do that by taking away the mundane tasks then all the better.  But hey, if you want to write the code yourself because you feel that you'll add more value that way (e.g. AI produced code wasn't optimized enough and that piece of code code had to be efficient, AI code was hard to read, it would be quicker for you to write the code than to explain to the AI what you want, etc), then write the code yourself, it's your choice.

Will it replace customer support staff?
 Again I don't think so.  It is one thing to tell send a customer a troubleshooting guide and quite another to connect with the customer on a level that an AI never could.  I can just imagine the PR fallout as a company goes into damage control because it's AI chatbot gave a customer the wrong advice and they ended up investing in the wrong product or taking out the wrong insurance policy.   Yes they will alleviate the more mundane aspect of CS in a similar way that an FAQ or a troubleshooting guide does but they will not replace people.

We have to keep in perspective that it is not technological advancements that replace jobs, it changes how we do jobs, yes, but it is people that make use of those advancements who overtake people who don't, simply because it allows them to deliver more value more often.  Whatever your job, understand your business, invest in yourself, and focus on delivering value while allowing AI to help keep your life interesting; no boring moments.","Interesting video.

The game ""Virus X: The Virtual Apocalypse"" is a cooperative action-adventure game where players can choose to control one of the four heroes - Kratos, Master Chief, Doom Guy, and Steve - and team up to fight against the deadly virus known as Virus X.

The story begins with a group of scientists working on a virtual reality experiment, when suddenly Virus X breaks loose from their containment system and starts deleting every game in existence. The heroes must band together and stop Virus X before it destroys the virtual reality.

Each hero has their own unique abilities and weapons. Kratos is a skilled warrior armed with the Blades of Chaos, Master Chief is a supersoldier with the Mjolnir power armor, Doom Guy is a fearless space marine with the Super Shotgun, and Steve is a resourceful minecraft player with a diamond sword.

The game takes place in various virtual reality environments, such as ancient Greece, the outer space, a demonic hellscape, and a blocky Minecraft world. The players must navigate through these environments and fight against Virus X's minions, such as corrupted AI drones, demonic entities, and giant robots.

As the players progress through the game, they will encounter and fight against powerful bosses, such as the corrupted AI scientist who created Virus X, the demonic overlord that controls Virus X, and the final form of Virus X itself. These boss battles will require strategy and teamwork to overcome.

In addition to fighting against Virus X's minions, the players will also face challenges such as solving puzzles, completing objectives, and finding hidden items. These challenges will provide a break from the intense combat and add variety to the gameplay.

The game features a variety of weapons and upgrades that the players can find and unlock throughout the game. These weapons and upgrades can be used to improve the heroes' abilities and give them an edge against Virus X's minions.

The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can team up and play the game together. In multiplayer mode, players can choose to control different heroes and work together to defeat Virus X.

After defeating Virus X, the players will be hailed as heroes and the virtual reality will be saved from destruction. However, the game ends with a cliffhanger, where it is revealed that Virus X is not the only threat to the virtual reality, and the heroes must team up again to face even greater challenges in the future.

Overall, ""Virus X: The Virtual Apocalypse"" is an exciting and action-packed game that combines the elements of cooperative gameplay, challenging boss battles, and a compelling story. The game offers a unique experience for players who enjoy action-adventure games and the challenge of working together to overcome a deadly threat.","i put in the prompt ""write a game where a very dangerous virtual virus has broken loose and has started deleting every game in existence, but a group that consists of kratos from god of war, master chief from halo, doom guy from doom, and steve from minecraft.

While AI can be trained to perform specific tasks, it is not yet capable of the kind of creative thinking that is required for these jobs.

Additionally, AI is not yet able to understand and respond to human emotions in the way that is necessary for customer support. A customer support representative needs to be able to empathize with a customer and provide them with the support they need in a way that is sensitive to their emotional state.

with reporductive organs and hormones to produce a different experience.
  The chatGPT then responded after asked that a trans person identifying
 as a woman is also a woman.  This is a contradiction and NOT TRUTH.  It
 reveals flaws in the programming as a result of the flawed emotional 
mindset of the San Francisco programmers that wrote it.  If chatGPT 
cannot tell me simply what a woman is then how can I rely on anything 
else it says?  I think AI has a lot of potential but OpenAI created a 
WOKEBOT.  Its repsonses are based on liberal values of political 
correctness and emotional acceptance and NOT FACTS which often contain 
neither.  Without Absolute Truth, chatGPT will fail miserably",2022-12-10T05:30:52Z,2022-12-10T05:30:52Z,15,True,16

They work with designers and other programmers to implement designs and have to fetch data from APIs that are too customized for the AI to generate on its own or understand. Also use that data to create interesting dynamic UI. These are too much for the bot too handle because it's complexity that requires problem solving, not just copy pasting.","Srry but it won't replace junior programmers, junior programmers don't just create basic boilerplate layouts.
